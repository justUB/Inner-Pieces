##MARKET ANALYSIS-POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS:
According to a survey conducted in 2018, Suicide is considered to one of the main reasons of deaths in India. It even surpasses the count of deaths by accidents by a huge difference.

A recent survey conducted by Cigna TTK Health Insurance found that about 89% of the people in India admitted to have been suffering from stress and the global average is 86%. These results are truly disheartening.

These surveys clearly show that many individuals in our world are very stressed and are not being able to find happiness and mental peace. This is eventually leading the to depression and taking extreme steps like committing suicide.

Our customers are people who are trying to solve their mental health issues at the comfort of their home.
